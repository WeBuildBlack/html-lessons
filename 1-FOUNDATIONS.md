# Foundations of HTML
So, what exactly is HTML? The abbreviation actually stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. In less geeky speak, it's a language that describes how content and information should look.

Our usual web page consists of things like headers, paragraphs and lists. To create these elements on page we use something called *tags*.

## What are tags?
To create an element we use a tag, and that looks like this:  
`<tagName>`
Tag names are case insensitive and enclosed in a less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`) symbol.

Tags may also have attributes so that we can attach extra information to them. For example:
`<tagName attribute="value">`
It's also important to note that tags can have multiple values.

## Containers
Most HTML tags that we use will be containers. What I mean by that is that they will be elements that contain some sort of content. For example, if we wanted to have a button that said "Click me", this is how we would do it:
`<button>Click me!</button>`
Notice that the second tag has a `/` before the tag name. This is because the `/` let's the browser know that this is the closing tag for the container tag. In this case `button` would be the tag and "Click me!" would be the content.

## Stick around for the next episode...
In the next lesson, we'll be touching on the basic template that every web developer uses and their starting point when building web pages. You won't get to put content on your page till the lesson after next, but trust that it's essential to building for the web. You trust me right? Right? Good...hopefully you said yes. Anyway, see you in the next lesson!
